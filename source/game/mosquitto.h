 * Important note
 * 
 * The following functions that deal with network operations will return
 * MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS on success, but this does not mean that the operation has
 * taken place. An attempt will be made to write the network data, but if the
 * socket is not available for writing at that time then the packet will not be
 * sent. To ensure the packet is sent, call mosquitto_loop() (which must also
 * be called to process incoming network data).
 * This is especially important when disconnecting a client that has a will. If
 * the broker does not receive the DISCONNECT command, it will assume that the
 * client has disconnected unexpectedly and send the will.

 * 
 * Parameters:
 *  mosq -       a valid mosquitto instance.
 *  on_publish - a callback function in the following form:
 *               void callback(void *obj, uint16_t mid)
 *
 * Callback Parameters:
 *  obj - the user data provided in <mosquitto_new>
 *  mid - the message id of the sent message.
