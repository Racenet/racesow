This release includes the following changes:

 o Added support for NTLM delegation to Samba's winbind daemon helper ntlm_auth
 o Display notes from setup file in testcurl.pl

This release includes the following bugfixes:

 o curl_getdate: detect some illegal dates better
 o when sending a request and an error is received before the (entire) request
   body is sent, stop sending the request and close the connection after
   having received the entire response. This is equally true if an Expect:
   100-continue header was used.
 o When using both -J and a single -O with multiple URLs, a missing init
   could cause a segfault
 o -J fixed for escaped quotes
 o -J fixed for file names with semicolons
 o progress: reset flags at transfer start to avoid wrong 
   CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD
 o curl_gssapi: Guard files with HAVE_GSSAPI and rename private header
 o silence picky compilers: mark unused parameters
 o help output: more gnu like output
 o libtests: stop checking for CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM
 o setting a non-HTTP proxy with an environment variable or with CURLOPT_PROXY
   / --proxy (without specifying CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE) would still make it do
   proxy-like HTTP requests
 o CURLFORM_BUFFER: insert filename as documented (regression)
 o SOCKS: fix the connect timeout
 o ftp_doing: bail out on error properly while multi interfacing
 o improved Content-Encoded decoding error message
 o asyn-thread: check for dotted addresses before thread starts
 o cmake: find winsock when building on windows
 o Curl_retry_request: check return code
 o cookies: handle 'secure=' as if it was 'secure'
 o tests: break busy loops in tests 502, 555, and 573
 o FTP: fix proxy connect race condition with multi interface and SOCKS proxy
 o RTSP: GET_PARAMETER requests have a body
 o fixed several memory leaks in OOM situations
 o bad expire(0) caused multi_socket API to hang
 o Avoid ftruncate() static define with mingw64
 o mk-ca-bundle.pl: ignore untrusted certs
 o builds with PolarSSL 1.0.0
