This is the source for the static linked libraries used in Warsow, with
the settings we use for building them. They are in the svn repository for
backup purposes (se we don't loose the settings and have to do it again).
The compiled libs are already included in Warsow source and they shouldn't
need to be rebuilt unless in exceptional occasions.

The configurations used for win32 builds:
libjpeg-6b: libjpeg/libjpeg_static.vcproj (Release).
