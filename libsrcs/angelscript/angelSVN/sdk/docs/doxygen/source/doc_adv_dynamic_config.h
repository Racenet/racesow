\page doc_adv_dynamic_config Dynamic configurations

AngelScript supports the concept for configuration groups. This can be used for example by application plug-ins
that wish to register their own interface with the script engine. When the plug-in is later removed, the configuration
group for that plug-in can also be removed from the AngelScript interface without having to reinitialize everything.

To register part of the interface in a configuration group, the registration should be done between calls to 
\ref asIScriptEngine::BeginConfigGroup "BeginConfigGroup" and \ref asIScriptEngine::EndConfigGroup "EndConfigGroup". 
This can be done as many times as desired, but groups cannot be nested.

To remove a configuration group the method \ref asIScriptEngine::RemoveConfigGroup "RemoveConfigGroup" should be called with the name given to the 
BeginConfigGroup. It is only possible to remove a config group that is not currently in use. Possible causes that 
prevents the removal of a group may be:

 - Another registered a function outside the group uses a type from the group
 - A script is currently built that uses a type or function from the group
 - An instance of a script object that uses a type or function from the group is alive
 
It can be difficult to determine exactly where the use comes from so here's a few steps to do when RemoveConfigGroup 
returns \ref asCONFIG_GROUP_IS_IN_USE.

 - Run a full cycle on the \ref doc_gc "garbage collector" to destroy lingering objects
 - \ref asIScriptEngine::DiscardModule "Discard" any module that may have been compiled with the group
 - Double check that no other group uses the entities from the group
