\page doc_samples_tutorial Tutorial

<b>Path:</b> /sdk/samples/tutorial/

This sample was written with the intention of explaining the basics of 
AngelScript, that is, how to configure the engine, load and compile a script, 
and finally execute a script function with parameters and return value.


 - LineCallback() function which aborts execution when the time is up
 - Strings
 - Registered global functions
 - Script function parameters and return value
 - Retrieving information about script exceptions
 - asIScriptGeneric for when the library doesn't support native calling convention






\page doc_samples_concurrent Concurrent scripts

<b>Path:</b> /sdk/samples/concurrent/

This sample shows how to execute two or more long running scripts in 
parallel. The scripts voluntarily hand over the control to the next script in 
the queue by calling the function Sleep().


 - Multiple scripts running in parallel
 - Sleep()
 - Strings
 - Registered global functions




\page doc_samples_console Console

<b>Path:</b> /sdk/samples/console/

This sample implements a simple console, which lets the user type in 
commands and also evaluate simple script statements.

 - ExecuteString()
 - Strings
 - Registered global functions
 - Registered global properties
 - Special function _grab() with overloads to receive and print resulting value from script statements



\page doc_samples_corout Co-routines

<b>Path:</b> /sdk/samples/coroutine/

This sample shows how co-routines can be implemented with AngelScript. Co-routines are
threads that can be created from the scripts, and that work together by voluntarily passing control
to each other by calling Yield().

 - Co-routines created from the scripts with variable parameter structure.
 - Strings
 - Registered global functions
 - Handling the variable argument type
 - Passing arguments to script functions


\page doc_samples_events Events

<b>Path:</b> /sdk/samples/events/

This sample has the script engine execute a long running script. The script execution is regularly 
interrupted by the application so that keyboard events can be processed, which execute another short 
script before resuming the execution of the main script. The event handling scripts change the state 
of the long running script.

 - LineCallback() function which suspends execution when the time is up
 - Strings
 - Registered global functions
 - Scripted event handlers



\page doc_samples_incl Include directive

<b>Path:</b> /sdk/samples/include/

This sample shows how to implement a very simple preprocessor to add support for the \#include 
directive, which allow the script writer to reuse common script code. The preprocessor simply adds 
the included scripts as multiple script sections, which is ok as AngelScript is able to resolve global 
declarations independently of their order. The preprocessor also makes sure that a script file is only 
included once, so the script writer doesn't have to take extra care to avoid multiple includes or even 
complicated circular includes.

 - LineCallback() functions which aborts execution when the time is up
 - Processing the \#include directive
 - Circular \#includes are resolved automatically
