libRocket Support Libraries
============================

This directory contains prebuilt versions of required support libraries for libRocket.
Currently this is only for RocketCore, if you want to use the Python bindings unfortunately
you'll need to compile the necessary libraries yourself.

Installation
============
To build libRocket with the provided Visual Studio and Xcode projects the support directory 
needs to reside at the same tree depth as rocket.

For example:

development/
  rocket/
  support/

Thats's it.
