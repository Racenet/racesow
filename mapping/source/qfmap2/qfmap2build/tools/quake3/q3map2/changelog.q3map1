Date		Version					Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------
2001-12-03	1.2 (ydnar) Alpha		Initial version (win32)

2001-12-03	1.2 (ydnar 2) Alpha		Tolerance expanded
									(more brush faces caught)
									
2001-12-04	1.2 (ydnar 3) Alpha		Detail faces inside other
									detail brushes now culled,
									Small against large detail
									faces also culled.

2001-12-04	1.2 (ydnar 4) Alpha		djbob found a bug where
									coincident caulk faces
									were causing textured
									faces to be caulked. Fixed.

2001-12-04	1.2 (ydnar 7) Alpha		5 and 6 were internal test
									versions. This version
									takes into account extra
									surface info, so coplanar
									clip brushes no longer
									cull away textured sides.

2001-12-22	1.2 (ydnar 8) Alpha		Optimized light. Lighting
									for most maps should now
									be measurable in minutes
									as opposed to hours.

2001-12-24	1.2 (ydnar 9) Alpha		Fixed light. It is still
									faster, but to enable
									"blinding fast" mode,
									you must supply the -fast
									switch on the commandline
									after -light. Fast mode
									should be approximately
									2x as fast as build 8.

2001-12-24	1.2 (ydnar 10) Alpha	Grid lighting is now
									optimized. Not as much
									as I would like, but
									a distance^2 cull before
									traces on EVERY SINGLE
									SURFACE LIGHT IN THE MAP
									certainly speeds things
									the fuck up. -fast not
									necessary to see this
									optimization. Also added
									the -cheap switch to
									limit light contributions
									to a point when it exceeds
									255 in R, G, and B. This
									*may* cause artifacts.
									Test away...

2001-12-24	1.2 (ydnar 11) Alpha	Now using PVS data (vis).
									Well constructed and
									hinted maps should now
									see a bit of a speedup.
									Lights in the void are
									also now removed as a
									byproduct.

2001-12-24	1.2 (ydnar 12) Alpha	Fixed bug that caused
									vlight to crash.

2001-12-27	1.2 (ydnar 13) Alpha	- Fixed broken PVS check.
									- Cheap now supresses sun
									Sun trace skipped if
									sample is "cheapened."
									- Experimental -smooth
									option for subsampling
									shadow edges.
									- Experimental radiosity
									code. Will probably crash.
									- Other minor optimizations.

2001-12-27	1.2 (ydnar 14) Alpha	Build 13 always subsampled,
									making it slower. Fixed.

2001-12-28	1.2 (ydnar 15) Alpha	Bad windings from edge- or
									vertex- manipulated brushes
									no longer created. Vertex
									lighting on func_* with
									an origin now works.
									Radiosity should be more
									stable (but not fully
									correct yet). Light
									envelopes now properly
									calculated for entities
									with origins.

2001-12-28	1.2 (ydnar 16) Alpha	Un-vised maps will now light.
									
2001-12-30	1.2 (ydnar 17) Alpha	Radiosity. Use q3map_bounce
									in shaders to specify
									amount of light to reflect.
									Use -bounce N after -light
									to enable radiosity. Use
									-dump to emit radiosity
									lights as a prefab.

2001-12-31	1.2 (ydnar 18) Alpha	Normalization release. New
									features include -fastgrid,
									-cheapgrid, and -fastbounce.
									Running with -fastgrid and
									-cheapgrid will produce
									results identical to normal
									q3map (with the lightgrid
									being a little darker).
									Also added q3map_nofast to
									shaders to override -fast
									switch for a surface light.

2002-01-01	1.2 (ydnar 19) Alpha	Fixed an odd vertex lighting
									bug (thanks Quakin) that was
									causing sun to leak to brush
									faces when using r_vertexlight
									ingame. Changed a little bit
									of the default behavior, so
									test with vertex lighting
									and with terrain. Minor
									shader changes might be
									necessary to get some maps to
									look as before.

2002-01-01	1.2 (ydnar 20) Alpha	Colored alpha shadows. Some
									minor optimizations in
									shadow tracing. Should be
									slightly faster than 19.

2002-01-02	1.2 (ydnar 21) Alpha	Set up colored shadows
									properly to use
									surfaceparm lightfilter.
									Shaders must use this parm
									to have colored shadows.
									Can be used with alphashadow
									as well.

2002-01-04	1.2.1-y1 (nightly)		This version is all new,
									based off the official
									GtkRadiant tree, which has
									all the previous enhancements.
									New features include colored
									lightgrid tracing through
									lightfilter shaders, and
									surfaceparm lightgrid, for
									large/space maps with large
									volumes. Also fixed are
									potential broken brush
									winding radiosity crashes.
									Maybe.

2002-01-05	1.2.1-y2 (nightly)		Merged latest CVS. Removed
									bug where ambient was getting
									calculated into the radiosity
									solution for every pass,
									leading to overbright maps
									in a hurry. Also removed
									the bad PTPFF reporting,
									as it only caused problems
									with radiosity in a big way.
									Sue me.

2002-01-05	1.2.1-y3 (nightly)		I really suck. Sample color
									now properly cleared to 0
									when bouncing.

2002-01-07	1.2.1-y4 (nightly)		Particle Studio generated
									brush faces should no longer
									be culled. I no longer cull
									faces that are autosprite.
									Added -bouncegrid to have
									radiosity add to lightgrid.

2002-01-08	1.2.1-y5 (nightly)		Same as y4, but compiled with
									full optimizations. Should
									be 10-25% faster in all,
									including BSP and vis
									stages.

2002-01-09	1.2.1-y6 (nightly)		Brushfaces with polygonoffset
									in their shader will no longer
									be faceculled.

2002-01-11	1.2.1-y7 (nightly)		Increased stack size for threads
									to 4MB on Win32 to (hopefully)
									elminate stack overflow
									crash with radiosity. Also
									made subdivision use the heap
									to lessen the stack load. Fixed
									bug where q3map_bounce was not
									being used in shader parsing.
									Redid some of the divide math
									to work in 0-255 instead of
									0-256.

2002-01-11	1.2.1-y8 (nightly)		More Win32 threading
									crutches. Eat me, Bill.

2002-01-15	1.2.1-y9				RR2DO2 noticed a stupid bug
									in my PVS code. Fixed it,
									so the PVS light opts work as
									they should. Lighting is
									faster. Also got rid of some
									redundant square roots from
									the raytracing, speeding up
									lighting another ~25%.

2002-01-20	1.2.1-y10				Fixed a potential crash bug
									with maps with 0 lights. Also
									changed how lightmaps are
									projected onto patches that
									lie in a single plane (bevel
									endcaps, floors, etc). Shadows
									now work properly on them.

2002-01-22	1.2.1-y11				Fixed a divide-by-zero crash
									with maps with no lights or
									no tracing. Also added
									code to make brush/patch
									vertex lighting more closely
									resemble lightmap, even on
									less-than-perfect maps. And
									-light is faster, too...about
									25% on q3dm17. 34->25 seconds.

2002-01-24	1.2.1-y12				Completely rewrote the path
									argument handling. Should find
									the Quake 3 dir and other
									dirs properly now. Needs to
									be tested on Linux though.
									Also made lights linear by
									default when run with -game
									wolf. This is to match the
									Gray Matter q3map and
									entity definition.

2002-01-28	1.2.4-y1				Merged from 1.2.4-nightly CVS
									sources. Fog sparklies gone.
									-nopatchfix so vlight works
									properly again. Cleaned up
									paths processing some more,
									including Linux stuff. Added
									_lightmapscale entity key.
									Brought -game wolf lighting
									to parity with GM tools.
									RR2DO2's PCX loading fix. A
									bunch of other useful fun shit.

2002-01-29	1.2.4-y2				Fixed a bug in RR2DO2's PCX fix.
									Fixed a stupid bug in lightmap
									dimension bounds checking (thanks
									Laerth).

2002-01-29	1.2.4-y3				Now will detect (and report to
									GtkRadiant) all degenerate patches
									like those created by capping a
									cone.

2002-02-23	2.0.0-a1 thru a3		Rewrote about 30% of the code.
									Lots of cool new shit.

2002-02-24	2.0.0-a4 thru a8		Terrain fix (thx Pointy), patches
									are no longer circus colored, more
									terrain texturing fixes.

2002-02-26	2.0.0-a10 thru a11		Adjacent coplanar surfaces now
									will share lightmaps. This prevents
									most wierd edge cases with filter
									and speeds things up a bit. Patches
									too.

2002-02-27	2.0.0-a12				More lightmap fixes for non-planar
									surfaces. Bugfixes in allocation/
									compression of lightmaps as well.

2002-03-02	2.0.0-a13				Fixed some surface light bugs,
									adjusted the occluded-luxel finding
									code, and amped the radiosity. Other
									fixes to RTCW lighting code (better
									angle attenuation on linear lights).

2002-03-04	2.0.0-a14				Vertex light should now be near-
									perfect on clean (and mostly on not-
									so-clean) maps. Unlit maps will no
									longer have tri-fanned brush faces
									with random vertex colors. VLight is
									now totally gone (reverts to -light).

2002-03-06	2.0.0-a15				Relaxed the planar check, should now
									classify all slightly-off plane brush
									face metasurfaces as planar. Triangle
									checking much more stringent as well.

2002-03-11	2.0.0-a16				Vis crash gone. Lightmap allocation
									now sorted by shader to minimize 
									shader count (and lessen chance for
									RTCW shader substitution bug). Hit
									big quarter-century also.

2002-03-12	2.0.0-a17				Dammit.

2002-03-12	2.0.0-a18				Hunting phantom lights...

2002-03-16	2.0.0-a19				Fogclip and _celshader. Check the
									extras folder...

2002-03-18	2.0.0-b1-rc1			Beta release candidate. Fixed the
									stupid phantom light bug finally.
									Tricked out the sun tracing a wee
									bit as well, should be a little
									faster + more accurate. Other little
									bits fixed up as well. Thanks to K,
									{wf}ShadowSpawn and RR2DO2 for their
									help tracking these last bugs down.

2002-03-19	2.0.0-b1-rc2			Increased some maximums, and got
									rid of some cruft.

2002-03-22	2.0.0-b1-rc3			Some minor optimizations.

2002-03-30	2.0.0-b1-rc5			Now with fur (see extras/fur.shader).

2002-04-01	2.0.0-b1-rc6			Enhanced with baby seal technology.

2002-05-01	2.0.1					OK, better late than never. Fixed the
									alphashadow = 255 = transparent bug.

2002-06-24	2.1.0-b1				Added _foghull functionality. Works
									like terrain "_shader" where
									you don't need "textures/" prefix.
									Also added q3map_normalmap. See
									NVIDIA's website for Photoshop filter
									to generate normalmaps from grayscale
									heightmaps. This makes lightmaps
									look bumpmapped. Currently 50% broken.

2002-07-06	2.2.0-b1				Empty epairs now stripped from map,
									fixing Wolfenstein crash bug. Func_*
									entities are now fogged properly.
									Sort of. This will be enhanced later.
									Added the .srf file to store all the
									extra crap I was hiding in the BSP.
									It's an editable text file that
									-light uses, so you can change the
									samplesize w/o recompiling the map
									(just -light'ing it). Changed color
									normalization to clamping, because
									it looks better. Other stuff got
									fixed as well.
									
2002-07-08	2.2.0-b2 thru b11		Test versions. Thanks jer and jet!

2002-07-09	2.2.0-b12 				Larger-than-life lightmaps are now
									supported, up to 1024x1024. Add
									q3map_lightmapSize H W to a shader
									to use. Lightmaps are stored in
									maps/{mapname}/_lm_NNN.tga and a
									shader script q3map_{mapname}.shader
									is generated. Also added
									q3map_lightmapGamma N.N. Use a
									value of 2.0 to simulate
									r_overBrightBits 1 and
									r_mapOverBrightBits 2 on external
									lightmap images.
