General concept
===============

Since version 0.5, warsow allows to extend the game by programming your own
gametypes. These are coded in AngelScript, a library that allows programs to
extend their functionalities by interfacing with C or C++. Angelscript syntax
is very similar to C++.

A gametype consists of one or several angelscript files (extension .as) calling
the game interface functions. These files are then loaded dynamically at game
startup.

Racesow is both a gametype for warsow and a modification of the base warsow
program. Indeed, the game interface accessible through angelscript was not
extended enough for a good gametype, that's why some modifications (mainly
mysql support and physics tweaks) were made directly in the warsow code.

Code structure
==============

Inside each branch of the svn repositories, you will find two subdirectories :

* **sdk** : this directory contains the warsow code (written in C) with the
  racesow specific modifications
* **warsow** : this directory contains the racesow gametype code written
  in AngelScript

See subsections for more details.

Coding style
============

* indentation : 4 spaces, no tabs
* newline for brackets
* spaces around operators
* spaces inside parenthesis
* use doxygen-like comments
* camel-case with first letter lower-case for variables and function names
* class names : words separated by underscores,
  each word starting with uper-case letter
  
Example::

    class Test_Class
    {
        /**
         * This is a test variable.
         */
        int testInt;
        
        /**
         * This is a test function.
         *
         * more details about testFunction
         * @param testArg the only argument of the function
         * @return some stupid bool
         */
        bool testFunction( int testArg )
        {
            if ( testArg == 0 )
            {
                return true;
            }
            else
            {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
