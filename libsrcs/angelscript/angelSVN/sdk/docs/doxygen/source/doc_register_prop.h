\page doc_register_prop Registering global properties

By registering global properties with the script engine you can allow the scripts to 
inspect and/or modify variables within the application directly, without the need to 
write special functions to do this.

To register the property, you just need to call the \ref asIScriptEngine::RegisterGlobalProperty 
"RegisterGlobalProperty" method, passing the declaration and a pointer to the property. 
Remember that the registered property must stay alive as long as its registration is 
valid in the engine.

\code
// Variables that should be accessible through the script.
int      g_number       = 0;
CObject *g_object       = 0;
Vector3  g_vector       = {0,0,0};
bool     g_readOnlyFlag = false;

// A function to register the global properties. 
void RegisterProperties(asIScriptEngine *engine)
{
    int r;
    
    // Register a primitive property that can be read and written to from the script.
    r = engine->RegisterGlobalProperty("int g_number", &g_number); assert( r >= 0 );
    
    // Register variable where the script can store a handle to a CObject type. 
    // Assumes that the CObject type has been registered with the engine already as a reference type.
    r = engine->RegisterGlobalProperty("CObject @g_object", &g_object); assert( r >= 0 );
    
    // Register a 3D vector variable.
    // Assumes that the Vector3 type has been registered already as a value type.
    r = engine->RegisterGlobalProperty("Vector3 g_vector", &g_vector); assert( r >= 0 );
    
    // Register a boolean flag that can be read, but not modified by the script.
    r = engine->RegisterGlobalProperty("const bool g_readOnlyFlag", &g_readOnlyFlag); assert( r >= 0 );
}
\endcode
